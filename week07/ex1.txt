Throughput of First Fit algorithm: 53.062072
Throughput of Best Fit algorithm: 20.530260
Throughput of Worst Fit algorithm: 22.411888

Obtained the results above, we can say that First Fit algorithm is definitely more efficient on that particular case when we have huge memory and few blocks to insert. It does not mean that other two algorithms are more useless. They enable more efficient usage of memory meanwhile it takes more time.
