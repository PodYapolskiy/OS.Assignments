1. Comment after moving myfile1.txt to /tmp/ and modifying myfile11.txt:
Monitor program reported on modified "myfile11.txt" and also 
illustrated that size of the file increased from 13 bytes up to 64

2. Comment after creating symbolic link and modifying /tmp/myfile1.txt:
Monitor also showed the event. Since we edit content in /tmp/file1.txt, 
it changes in every file with the same i-node and symbolic link also points on
changed data

3. Comment after removing dublicates of hard links in watched directory:
After unlinking only in the watched directory, the only "myfile12.txt" 
was unlinked and "myfile11.txt" left the last one.
That did not touch the /tmp/myfile1 because we checked files only 
in the watched directory. And we also did not count symbolic links.

After removal we obtained that number of hard links appeared as 2.
Exactly the value that can be expected since "myfile1" kept in given path directory
and "/tmp/myfile1" stayed unchanged. They still keeps the same i-node number.
